{{< speaker_note >}}

#### **Continuous learning \@course level:**

-   The job landscape is highly dynamic today.
-   Always keep an eye on the skills in high demand and the courses that people are taking to remain relevant.

#### **Flexibility \@program level:**

-   One must always keep an open mind regarding their career plans.

#### **Networking and enable students to take the leap (for connection):**

-   It is always good to remain in touch with professional colleagues (engage with professional media sites e.g LinkedIn, competition challenges e.g. on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)).
-   a role in another team at a lower position provides the student with the chance to develop new connections or acquire new skills (Cloud Computing certification, etc). {{< /speaker_note >}}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Lecture Prep and Innovation

-   These preparations are done in advance, before the respective week or course begins.
    -   Creating lesson plans - MAT161,
    -   Verifying if slides and lesson plans have the same information - MAT161,
    -   Creating tests - ACW1781(ST), MAT161(CT2),

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Student Satisfaction

-   Use of `Reflect` tab from `Teams` to gather students' reviews. *![Reflect](images/reflection.png)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Graduant Success Rate

In-line math: $x + y = z$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Research on Future Curricula

-   Improve ways of teaching Machine Learning 381 and 382,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Faculty Staff Development

-   Better ways of communicating with students as a **Team** through short demo videos. [View here\>\>\>](https://belgiumcampusacza-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/cheteni_e_belgiumcampus_ac_za/EZnOLIrSkPlJqtsqg_0UUAoBAX3d_jS5ML7jt9uxhfhI2A) ![](images/posting.png)

-   Organizing marks for students' assessments using `VLOOKUP` through short demo videos. [View here\>\>\>](https://belgiumcampusacza-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/cheteni_e_belgiumcampus_ac_za/Eau1zFZpO4NNursd5E3h8EgBA9dr2vMHR0MaERRY_L219w?e=genbFH)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### AIT Supervision

-   Info sessions conducted twice every year.![](images/ait-1.png)
-   Follow Up on students without submitting and others without internship for updates.![](images/follow-up.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Research Participation

-   Research about relevant topics to include in ACW1781 Summative Test.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Moderation Management

> Moderates assessments;

-   Tests
-   Exams

> Moderates students' exams scripts;

-   Quarter 1: ST
-   Quarter 2: STA2781, LPR181, COA181,
-   Quarter 3: MAT281

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deadline Adherance

-   Meeting deadlines (submitting marks a week after an assessment is written)
-   Few hurdles as the assessments are done on AQ that delays the submission.![](images/deadlines.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Class Management and Preps

-   Sitting arrangement, students to sit closer to front for improved concentration.
-   Making sure venue is accessible in time (5-10mins before).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Subject File Updates

-   Updating slides,
-   Making sure assignments are up to date,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Extra Curricular Engagement

-   Not yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Future Plans

#### Short-term goals

-   To gain a new skills.
-   To boost my networking abilities.
-   Blog posting.

{{< speaker_note >}}
- To boost my networking abilities in the Data Science space.
- Geo-spatial and Network analysis for Business Analytics using R.
- Create blog posts on how to use R in solving business problems as this will benefit students as well as other individuals and companies. 
  {{< /speaker_note >}}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Long-term goals

-   Earn a $2^{nd}$ Masters Degree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Performance review goals

-   Productivity goals
-   Problem-solving goals
-   Documentation goals

{{< speaker_note >}}
Use the power of R: 
- to increase enrollment using network analysis,
