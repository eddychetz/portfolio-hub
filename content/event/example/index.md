My **COURSE DESIGN**; Ability to cover content to make students industrial-ready as they leave college.
{{% /callout %}}
:arrow_forward:  This section outlines the designing process of the modules that are part of the Data Science cluster. Applied Mathematics 1781/281 and Machine Learning 381-2 are the courses that will be used in this portfolio. Each module is given 16 hours per week of contact time with the subject matter expert (4-hour lesson with a 15 minute break after every 2 hours).

:arrow_forward:  Initially, the Applied Mathematics 121 (now Applied Mathematics 281) module was designed in such a way that it transforms first year students into tertiary education environment and equipped them with basic understanding of advanced algebra, functions, vectors and matrices among other concepts. These topics connects the student with the system, enabling the understanding of foundation concepts into a Data Science career. This is a five-credit semester module.

:arrow_forward: Successful completion of this 2nd year module is based on the grading scale of 30% CA and 70% of a 2-hours proctored EXAM written at the end of quarter in which the module is being offered. This is normally 1st quarter as it is a pre-requisite to other modules such As Machine Learning 381. Outcomes of this module are covered within a period of 3 weeks. A student is required to submit 3 individual assignments, and to write 3 continuous assessment tests every last day of the week that is 2 formative assessments and one Summative assessment at the end. These test will be proctored in a customized, monitored online environment. This only leave the student with approx. 16 hours per week of contact time with the subject matter expert.

:arrow_forward: Machine learning 381 module is designed to give the student foundation to Machine learning concepts (Regression, classification, and clustering topics for supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms). This module spans up to 2 weeks duration with 2 proctored, weekly tests and 1 project. This is also a five-credit semester module. The module prepares the student for Machine Learning 382 practical module to which the student is expected to apply the foundation concepts of Machine Learning 381, Python and/or R programming skills from other modules of the program and Mathematics 281 concepts to some real-world data sets.

**TEACHING AND LEARNING STRATEGIES**

**Strategies** in Data Science teaching
{{% /callout %}}

:arrow_forward: My approach to teaching and learning is very unique and vary from one module to another. Applied Mathematics is a theoretical subject, students are required to understand the fundamental concepts of the subject and reflect its outcomes to some real-world application. In order to achieve this, outcomes are explained, demonstrated on a whiteboard to allow everyone to visualize and understand the concept. Students are given breathing space to digest concepts before assigning them tasks during the lecture session. Students are not given solutions to these activities to allow them to be fully engaged in the course study. My classes encourage active participation of students in order to fully understand the subject.

:arrow_forward: When conducting the lecture in an online environment, students are required to give feedback privately when they are given tasks to do. This helps with control of the lesson to avoid disruptions in thinking to students that are slow a bit. Once the majority of the students provide feedback, one of the students is voluntarily selected to share the feedback with the entire class. This enables students to understand better when explained by their peers. 

This teaching approach is mostly employed in both online and face-to-face environments when teaching theoretical subjects such as Applied Mathematics 281 and Machine Learning 381.

**STUDENTS' ASSESSMENTS**

**Introduction** 
{{% /callout %}}

:arrow_forward: Assessments given to students are fair enough to address all angles, linking theory with hands-on that is industrial-related examples. In the case of Applied Mathematics 281, students are given 3 assignments to submit within the course duration with specific deadlines. There are 3 weekly tests as well to be written in a monitored environment of which the first 2 tests are formative and the last is summative assessment.

**Course weights** 
{{% /callout %}}

:arrow_forward: Apart from all of these graded assessments, students are given a lot of activities during the course study, this includes practice questions with solutions as homework, mock tests for every graded test to allow them more engagement and participation especially passive learners. A student is required to score at least 50% of the total weights in order to write examination at the end of quarter in which the course is being offered. The examination carries 70% while the continuous assessment contributes 30%.

:arrow_forward: For every assessment given to students, there is a feedback session organized for the class to catch up on their flaws before the next test. This is conducted collectively within the lesson time in an organized way and as their instructor, I will make sure that everyone is satisfied with their mistakes and understood what was required for each and every question of that particular assessment.

**SELF EVALUATION** 
{{% /callout %}}

{{% callout note %}}
Assessing my own **Teaching Practices** to measure performance against set standards.
{{% /callout %}}

:arrow_forward: Assessment of my own work is a great deal as this opens up room for adjustments where necessary. Teaching and learning is continuous process for both students and the instructor. I have realized a lot in my teaching and learning journey and discovered that it takes two to achieve something great in the process. Assessment of students is crucial in terms of determining the level of understanding of the content delivered during class sessions. Most of the students that do actively participate in class are always excelling and they do accept the challenge. In order to improve the success rate of passive students, as their tutor, I do encourage collaborative (More of teaching prac , sec 4) tasks in groups and everyone to take part in that particular task. Your input determines your level of understanding thus giving me a heads up on how much you need assistance as a student.

:arrow_forward: In every assessment, results are a key measure of success as it locates the students’ knowledge level. This helps me to identify challenging topics that need more attention in detail. These topics help me to adjust my teaching strategy in the future and give me a signal to address them in the weekly assessment review sessions. Overall results of an assessment also help in identifying students at risk and action is taken to assist the identified students such remedial sessions as well as assigning them to the active learner to be assisted during their study sessions.
