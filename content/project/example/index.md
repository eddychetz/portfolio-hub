summary: Used data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem, use data analysis tools to ingest a dataset, clean it and wrangle it, use data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modelling process, and use machine learning skills to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently.

## Project Overview

The people of New York use the 311 system to report complaints about the non-emergency problems to local authorities. Various agencies in New York are assigned these problems. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development of New York City is the agency that processes 311 complaints that are related to housing and buildings.

In the last few years, the number of 311 complaints coming to the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has increased significantly. Although these complaints are not necessarily urgent, the large volume of complaints and the sudden increase is impacting the overall efficiency of operations of the agency.

Therefore, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has approached your organization to help them manage the large volume of 311 complaints they are receiving every year.
